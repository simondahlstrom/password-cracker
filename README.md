This is my first try to make some sort of password cracker.
You can add the hashes to the hashes.txt file that you want the plain text password to. Python will make use of the md5 import to 
compare the hash you provided and the plain text in a word text file, I suggest rockyou.txt

I will get back into in a bit and make it a lot better.
